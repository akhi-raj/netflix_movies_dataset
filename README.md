# Netflix Movies Dataset SQL Analysis and Dashboard Creation

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix data using SQL to explore trends, user behaviors, and content insights. The dataset provides comprehensive details on Netflix movies, series, ratings, and usage statistics, allowing us to derive insights into Netflix’s content library, user preferences, and overall streaming patterns. This project is ideal for showcasing SQL skills, including data cleaning, complex queries, data aggregation, and performance optimization, followed by dashboard creation in Power BI to visualize these insights effectively.

> Note: This project is created solely for portfolio purposes to demonstrate SQL and data visualization skills. It is not intended for commercial, official, or monetary purposes.
